<h1>Homework Overview</h1>
Vast amounts of digital data are generated each day, but raw data are often not immediately ‚Äúusable‚Äù. Instead, we are interested in the information content of the data: what patterns are captured? This assignment covers a few useful tools for acquiring, cleaning, storing, and visualizing datasets.

In Question 1 (Q1), you will collect data using an API for <em>The Movie Database</em> (TMDb). You will construct a graph representation of this data that will show which actors have acted together in various movies, and use <em>Argo Lite</em> to visualize this graph and highlight patterns that you find. This exercise demonstrates how visualizing and interacting with data can help with discovery.

In Q2, you will construct a TMDb database in SQLite, with tables capturing information such as how well each movie did, which actors acted in each movie, and what the movie was about. You will also partition and combine information in these tables in order to more easily answer questions such as ‚Äúwhich actors acted in the highest number of movies?‚Äù.

In Q3, you will visualize temporal trends in movie releases, using a JavaScript-based library called D3. This part will show how creating interactive rather than static plots can make data more visually appealing, engaging and easier to parse.

Data analysis and visualization is only as good as the quality of the input data. Real-world data often contain missing values, invalid fields, or entries that are not relevant or of interest. In Q4, you will use OpenRefine to clean data from Mercari, and construct GREL queries to filter the entries in this dataset.

Finally, in Q5, you will build a simple web application that displays a table of TMDb data on a single-page website. To do this, you will use Flask, a Python framework for building web applications that allows you to connect Python data processing on the back end with serving a site that displays these results.

<h1>Q1 [40 points] Collect data from TMDb and visualize co-actor network</h1>
Q1.1 [30 points] Collect data from TMDb and build a graph

&nbsp;

For this Q1.1, you will be using and submitting a python file<strong>.</strong> Complete all tasks according to the instructions found in <strong>submission.py </strong>to complete the Graph class, the TMDbAPIUtils class, and the two global functions. The Graph class will serve as a re-usable way to represent and write out your collected graph data. The TMDbAPIUtils class will be used to work with the TMDB API for data retrieval.

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> You <strong>must</strong> only use a version of Python ‚â• 3.7.0 and &lt; 3.8 for this question. This question has been developed, tested for these versions. You <strong>must not</strong> use any other versions (e.g., Python 3.8). While we want to be able to extend to more Python versions, the specified versions are what we can definitively support at this time.

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> You must only use the modules and libraries provided at the top of <strong>submission.py</strong> and modules from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">Python Standard Library</a><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">.</a> <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://numpy.org/">Numpy</a> <strong>CANNOT</strong> be used ‚Äî while we understand that they are useful libraries to learn, completing this question is not critically dependent on their functionality. In addition, to enable our TAs to provide better, more consistent support to our students, we have decided to focus on the subset of libraries.

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> We will call each function once in <strong>submission.py</strong> during grading.&nbsp; The total runtime of submission.py must not exceed 10 minutes. Submissions exceeding this limit will receive <strong>zero</strong> credit. The average runtime of the code during grading is expected to take approximately 4 seconds.&nbsp; When we grade, we will take into account what your code does, and aspects that may be out of your control. For example, sometimes the server may be under heavy load, which may significantly increase the response time (e.g., the closer it is to HW1 deadline, likely the longer the response time!).

</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>[10 pts] Implementation of the TMDbAPIUtils class according to the instructions in <strong>py. </strong>You will use version 3 of the TMDb API to download data about actors and their co-actors. To use the TMDb API:
<ul>
<li>Create a TMDb account and obtain your client id / client secret which are required to obtain an authentication Token. Refer to <a href="https://poloclub.github.io/cse6242-2021spring-online/hw1/7urMEMxDF8_tmdb_registration_instructions.pdf">this</a> document for detailed instructions (log in using your</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
GT account).

<ul>
<li>Refer to the <a href="https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction">TMDB API Documentation</a> as you work on this question. The documentation contains a helpful ‚Äòtry-it-out‚Äô feature for interacting with the API calls.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>[10 pts] Producing correct <strong>csv</strong> and <strong>edges.csv.</strong> You must upload your <strong>nodes.csv</strong> and <strong>edges.csv</strong> files to Argo-Lite as directed in Q1.2.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Q1.2 builds on the results of Q1.1

Q1.2 [10 points] Visualizing a graph of co-actors using Argo-Lite

Using Argo Lite, visualize a network of actors and their co-actors.

You will produce an Argo Lite graph snapshot your <strong>edges.csv</strong> and <strong>nodes.csv</strong> from Q1.1.c.

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>To get started, review <a href="https://github.com/poloclub/argo-graph-lite">Argo Lite‚Äôs readme on</a> <a href="https://github.com/poloclub/argo-graph-lite">GitHub</a><a href="https://github.com/poloclub/argo-graph-lite">.</a> Argo Lite has been open-sourced.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>Importing your Graph
<ul>
<li>Launch <a href="https://poloclub.github.io/argo-graph-lite/">Argo Lite</a></li>
<li>From the menu bar, click ‚ÄòGraph‚Äô ‚Üí ‚ÄòImport CSV‚Äô. In the dialogue that appears:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
o Select ‚ÄòI have both nodes and edges file‚Äô

<ul>
<li>Under Nodes, use ‚ÄòChoose File‚Äô to select <strong>csv</strong> from your computer o Leave ‚ÄòHas Headers‚Äô selected o Verify ‚ÄòColumn for Node ID‚Äô is ‚Äòid‚Äô</li>
<li>Under Edges, use ‚ÄòChoose File‚Äô to select <strong>csv</strong> from your computer o Verify ‚ÄòColumn for Source ID‚Äô is ‚Äòsource‚Äô o Select ‚ÄòColumn for Target ID‚Äô to ‚Äòtarget‚Äô o Verify ‚ÄòSelected Delimiter‚Äô is ‚Äò,‚Äô</li>
<li>At the bottom of the dialogue, verify that ‚ÄòAfter import, show‚Äô is set to ‚ÄòAll Nodes‚Äô</li>
<li>The graph will load in the window. Note that the layout is paused by default; you can select to ‚ÄòResume‚Äô or ‚ÄòPause‚Äô layout as needed.</li>
<li>Dragging a node will ‚Äòpin‚Äô it, freezing its position. Selecting a pinned node, right clicking it, then choosing ‚Äòunpin selected‚Äô will unpin that node, so its position will once again be computed by the graph layout algorithm.&nbsp; Experiment with pinning and unpinning nodes.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> If a malformed .csv is uploaded, Argo-Lite could become un-responsive. If you suspect this is the case, open the developer tools for your browser and review any console error messages.

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>[7 points] Setting graph display options</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>On ‚ÄúGraph Options‚Äù panel, under ‚ÄòNodes‚Äô ‚Üí ‚ÄòModifying All Nodes‚Äô, expand ‚ÄòColor‚Äô menu o Select Color by ‚Äòdegree‚Äô, with scale: ‚ÄòLinear Scale‚Äô
<ul>
<li>Select a color gradient of your choice that will assign lighter colors to nodes with higher node degrees, and darker colors to nodes with lower degrees ‚óè Collapse the ‚ÄòColor‚Äô options, expand the ‚ÄòSize‚Äô options.</li>
<li>Select ‚ÄòScale by‚Äô to ‚Äòdegree‚Äô, with scale: Linear Scale‚Äô o Select meaningful Size Range values of your choice or use the default range.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Collapse the ‚ÄòSize‚Äô options</li>
<li>On the Menu, click ‚ÄòTools‚Äô ‚Üí ‚ÄòData Sheet‚Äô ‚óè Within the ‚ÄòData Sheet‚Äô dialogue:
<ul>
<li>Click ‚ÄòHide All‚Äô</li>
<li>Set ‚Äò10 more nodes with highest degree‚Äô o Click ‚ÄòShow‚Äô and then close the ‚ÄòData Sheet‚Äô dialogue</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click and drag a rectangle selection around the visible nodes</li>
<li>With the nodes selected, configure their node visibility by setting the following:
<ul>
<li>Go to ‚ÄòGraph Options‚Äô ‚Üí ‚ÄòLabels‚Äô o Click ‚ÄòShow Labels of Selected Nodes‚Äô</li>
<li>At the bottom of the menu, select ‚ÄòLabel By‚Äô to ‚Äòname‚Äô</li>
<li>Adjust the ‚ÄòLabel Length‚Äô so that the full text of the actor name is displayed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Show only non-leaf vertices. On the Menu, click ‚ÄòTools‚Äô ‚Üí Data Sheet‚Üí ‚ÄòShow <em>k</em> More Nodes with Highest Degree‚Äô. (where <em>k</em> is the input number of nodes such that <strong>only nodes with a degree &gt; 1 are visible</strong>).&nbsp; To make this easier, we suggest writing a utility function in your Graph class to find the count of leaf nodes in order to determine how many nodes should be shown. <em>&nbsp;</em></li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The result of this workflow yields a graph with the sizing and coloring depend upon the node degree and the nodes with the highest degree are emphasized by showing their labels.&nbsp; Also,

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>[3 points] Designing a meaningful graph layout</li>
</ol>
Using the following guidelines, create a visually meaningful and appealing layout:

<ul>
<li>Reduce as much edge crossing as possible</li>
<li>Do not allow any nodes to overlap</li>
<li>Keep the graph compact and symmetric as possible</li>
<li>Use the nodes‚Äô spatial positions to convey information (e.g., ‚Äúclusters‚Äù or groups)</li>
<li>Experiment with showing additional node labels. If showing all node labels creates too much visual complexity, show at least 10 ‚Äúimportant‚Äù node labels. You may decide what ‚Äúimportance‚Äù mean to you. For example, you may consider nodes (actors) having higher connectivity as potentially more ‚Äúimportant‚Äù (based on how the graph is built).</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

The objective of this task is to familiarize yourself with basic, important graph visualization features. Therefore, this is an <strong>open-ended task</strong> and most designs are acceptable&nbsp; You should experiment with Argo Lite‚Äôs features, changing node size and shape, etc. In practice, it is not possible to create ‚Äúperfect‚Äù visualizations for most graph datasets. The above guidelines are ones that generally help. However, like most design tasks, creating a visualization is about making selective design compromises. Some guidelines could create competing demands and following all guidelines may not guarantee a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù design.

&nbsp;

If you want to save your Argo Lite graph visualization snapshot locally to your device, so you can continue working on it later, we recommend the following workflow.

<ul>
<li>Select ‚ÄòGraph‚Äô ‚Üí ‚ÄòSave Snapshot‚Äô o In the ‚ÄòSave Snapshot` dialog, click ‚ÄòCopy to Clipboard‚Äô
<ul>
<li>Open an external text editor program such as TextEdit or Notepad. Paste the clipboard contents of the graph snapshot, and save it to a file with a <strong>.json</strong>&nbsp; You should be able to accomplish this with a default text editor on your computer by overriding the default file extension and manually entering ‚Äò.json‚Äô.</li>
<li>You may save your progress by saving the snapshot and loading them into Argo Lite to continue your work.</li>
<li>To load a snapshot, choose ‚ÄòGraph‚Äô ‚Üí ‚ÄòOpen Snapshot‚Äô ‚óè Select the graph snapshot you created.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Q1.2 (d) will not be graded on Gradescope.&nbsp; We will give a qualitative score on the overall design and presentation of your graph visualization in Argo Lite.

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>Publish and Share your graph snapshot
<ul>
<li>Name your graph: On the top navigation bar, click on the label ‚ÄòUntitled Graph‚Äô. In the ‚ÄòRename Snapshot‚Äô dialogue window that appears, enter your GTUsername as the ‚ÄòSnapshot Name‚Äô and click ‚ÄòDone‚Äô</li>
<li>Select ‚ÄòGraph ‚Äò ‚Üí ‚ÄòPublish and Share Snapshot‚Äô ‚Üí ‚ÄòShare‚Äô</li>
<li>Next, click ‚ÄòCopy to Clipboard‚Äô to copy the generated URL</li>
<li>Return the URL in the return_argo_lite_snapshot() function in <strong>py</strong> If you modify your graph after you publish and share a URL, you will need to re-publish and obtain a new URL of your latest graph. Only the graph snapshot shared via the URL will be graded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> If this function returns a malformed or invalid snapshot URL, it will likely cause Gradescope to crash.

&nbsp;

<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deliverables:</strong>&nbsp; Submit the following file to Gradescope:<strong>submission.py</strong>: the completed Python file

<h1>Q2 [35 points] SQLite</h1>
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> is a lightweight, serverless, embedded database that can easily handle multiple gigabytes of data. It is one of the world‚Äôs most popular embedded database systems. It is convenient to share data stored in an SQLite database ‚Äî just one cross-platform file which does not need to be parsed explicitly (unlike CSV files, which have to be parsed).

&nbsp;

You will modify the given <strong>Q2_SQL.py </strong>file by adding SQL statements to it. We suggest that you consider testing your SQL locally on your computer using interactive tools to speed up testing and debugging, such as DB Browser for SQLite <a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">(</a><a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">https://sqlitebrowser.org</a><a href="https://sqlitebrowser.org/">)</a>.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> You <strong>must</strong> only use a version of Python ‚â• 3.7.0 and &lt; 3.8 for this question. This question has been developed, tested for these versions. You <strong>must not</strong> use any other versions (e.g., Python 3.8). The Autograder is using SQLite release 3.22.

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE: </strong>Do not modify the import statements, everything you need to complete this question has been imported for you. You may not use other libraries for this assignment.

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> A Sample class has been provided for you to see some sample SQL statements, you can turn off this output by changing the global variable SHOW to False. This <strong>must </strong>be set to <em>false</em> before uploading to Gradescope.

&nbsp;

<strong>GTusername</strong> ‚Äì Please update the method GTusername with your credentials

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE: </strong>For the questions in this section, you must only use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join_inner.asp">INNER JOIN</a> when performing a join between two tables. Other types of joins may result in incorrect results.

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>[9 points] <em>Create tables and import data</em>.
<ol>
<li>[2 points] Create two tables (via two separate methods, part_ai_1 and part_ai_2, respectively in Q2_SQL.py) named movies and movie_cast with columns having the indicated data types:
<ol>
<li>movies
<ol>
<li>id (integer) 2. title (text)</li>
<li>score (real)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>movie_cast
<ol>
<li>movie_id (integer)</li>

</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>[2 points] Import the provided <strong>csv</strong> file into the movies table and <strong>movie_cast.csv</strong> into the movie_cast table
<ol>
<li>You will write Python code that imports the .csv files into the individual tables. This will include looping though the file and using the <strong>‚ÄòINSERT INTO‚Äô</strong> SQL command. Only use relative paths while importing files since absolute/local paths are specific locations that exist only on your computer and will cause the auto-grader to fail.</li>
</ol>

</ol>
&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>[5 points]<em> Vertical Database Partitioning. </em>Database partitioning is an important technique that</li>
</ul>
divides large tables into smaller tables, which may help speed up queries. For this question you will create a new table cast_bio from the movie_cast table (i.e., columns in cast_bio will be a subset of those in movie_cast) Do not edit the movie_cast table. Be sure that when you insert into the new cast_bio that the values are unique. Please read <a href="https://www.sqlshack.com/database-table-partitioning-sql-server/">this page</a> for an example of vertical database partitioning.

The view should have the format: good_collaboration( cast_member_id1, cast_member_id2, movie_count, average_movie_score)

&nbsp;

For symmetrical or mirror pairs, only keep the row in which cast_member_id1 has a lower numeric value. For example, for ID pairs (1, 2) and (2, 1), keep the row with IDs (1, 2). There should not be any ‚Äúself pair‚Äù where the value of cast_member_id1 is the same as that of cast_member_id2.

<li>[4 points] SQLite supports simple but powerful Full Text Search (FTS) for fast text-based querying (<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html">FTS</a> <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html">documentation</a><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html">)</a>. Import movie overview data from the <strong>csv</strong> into a new FTS table called movie_overview with the schema:</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

movie_overview

‚ñ™ id (integer) ‚ñ™ overview (text)

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Create the table using <strong>fts3</strong> or <strong>fts4</strong> only. Also note that keywords like NEAR, AND, OR and NOT are case sensitive in FTS queries.

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>[1 point] Count the number of movies whose overview field contains the word ‚Äòfight‚Äô. Matches are not case sensitive. Match full words, not word parts/sub-strings.</li>
</ol>
e.g., Allowed: ‚ÄòFIGHT‚Äô, ‚ÄòFight‚Äô, ‚Äòfight‚Äô, ‚Äòfight.‚Äô.&nbsp; Disallowed: ‚Äògunfight‚Äô, ‚Äòfighting‚Äô, etc.

<h1>Q3 [15 points] D3 (v5) Warmup</h1>
<strong>Read chapters 4-8 of Scott Murray‚Äôs </strong><a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/interactive-data-visualization/9781491921296/ch04.html#setup-chapter4"><strong>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, 2nd edition</strong></a> (sign in using your GT account, e.g., jdoe3@gatech.edu). You may also briefly review chapters 1-3 if you need additional background on web development. <strong>This simple reading provides important foundation</strong> you will need for Homework 2. This question uses D3 version v5, while the book covers D3 v4. What you learn from the book is transferable to v5. In Homework 2, you will work with D3 extensively.

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE the following important points: </strong>

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>We highly recommend that you use the latest Chrome browser to complete this question. We will grade your work using <strong>Chrome 86.0 (or newer)</strong>.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol start="2">
<li>For this homework, the D3 library is provided to you in the <strong>lib</strong> You must <strong>NOT</strong> use any D3 libraries (d3*.js) other than the ones provided. In Gradescope, these libraries will be provided for you in the autograding environment.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol start="3">
<li>You will need to setup an HTTP server to run your D3 visualizations as discussed in the D3 lecture (OMS students: the video ‚ÄúWeek 5 ‚Äì Data Visualization for the Web (D3) ‚Äì Prerequisites: JavaScript and SVG‚Äù. Campus students: see <a href="https://poloclub.github.io/cse6242-2021spring-campus/slides/CSE6242-500-infovis-stolper.pdf">lecture PDF</a><a href="https://poloclub.github.io/cse6242-2021spring-campus/slides/CSE6242-500-infovis-stolper.pdf">.</a>). The easiest way is to use <a href="https://medium.com/@ryanblunden/create-a-http-server-with-one-command-thanks-to-python-29fcfdcd240e">server</a> for Python 3.x. <strong>Run your local HTTP server in the hw1-skeleton/Q3 folder. </strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol start="4">
<li>We have provided sections of code along with comments in the skeleton to help you complete the implementation. While you do not need to remove them, you may need to write additional code to make things work. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol start="5">
<li>All d3*.js files in the <strong>lib</strong> folder are referenced using <strong>relative paths</strong> in your html file. For example, since the file ‚ÄúQ3/submission.html‚Äù uses d3, its header contains: <strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>&lt;script&nbsp; type=‚Äùtext/javascript‚Äù src=‚Äùlib/d3/d3.min.js‚Äù&gt;&lt;/script&gt; It is incorrect to use an absolute path such as:</strong></li>
</ol>
&lt;script type=‚Äùtext/javascript‚Äù src=‚Äùhttp://d3js.org/d3.v5.min.js‚Äù&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&nbsp;

The 3 files that are referenced are:

<ul>
<li>lib/d3/d3.min.js</li>
<li>lib/d3-dsv/d3-dsv.min.js</li>
<li>lib/d3-fetch/d3-fetch.min.js</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>In your html / js code<strong>, </strong>use a <strong>relative path</strong> to read in the dataset file<strong>.</strong> For example, since Q3 requires reading data from the csv file, the path should be ‚Äòq3.csv‚Äô and <strong>NOT</strong> an absolute path such as ‚ÄúC:/Users/polo/HW1skeleton/Q3/q3.csv‚Äù. Absolute/local paths are specific locations that exist only on your computer, which means your code will <strong>NOT</strong> run on our machines when we grade (and you will lose points). Gradescope will provide a copy of the q3.csv dataset using the same directory structure provided in the HW skeleton.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<ol start="7">
<li>Load the data from csv using D3 fetch methods. We recommend d3.dsv(). Handle any data conversions that might be needed, <em>e.g., </em>strings that need to be converted to integer. See <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-fetch#dsv">https://github.com/d3/d3</a><a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-fetch#dsv">‚Äì</a><a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-fetch#dsv">fetch#dsv</a></li>
</ol>
<strong>submission.html</strong> : when run in a browser, it should display a vertical barplot with the following specifications:

<ol start="3">
<li>[3.5 points] The barplot must display one bar per row in the csv dataset. Each bar corresponds to the running total of movies for a given year.&nbsp; The height of each bar represents the running total.&nbsp; The bars are ordered by ascending time with the earliest observation at the far left.&nbsp; i.e., 1880, 1890,</li>
</ol>
‚Ä¶, 2000

<ol>
<li>[1 point] The bars must have the same fixed width, and there must be some space between two bars, so that the bars do not overlap.</li>
<li>[3 points] The plot must have visible X and Y axes that scale according to the generated bars. That is, the axes are driven by the data that they are representing. Likewise, the ticks on these axes must adjust automatically based on the values within the datasets, i.e., they must not be hard-coded. The x-axis must be a &lt;g&gt; element having the id: ‚Äúx_axis‚Äù and the y-axis must be a &lt;g&gt; element having the id: ‚Äúy_axis‚Äù.</li>
<li>[2 points] Set x-axis label to ‚ÄòYear‚Äô and y-axis label to ‚ÄòRunning Total‚Äô. The x-axis label must be a &lt;text&gt; element having the id: ‚Äúx_axis_label‚Äù and the y-axis label must be a &lt;text&gt; element having the id: ‚Äúy_axis_label‚Äù.</li>
<li>[1 point] Use a linear scale for the Y axis to represent the running total (recommended function:</li>
</ol>
d3.scaleLinear()).

<ol>
<li>[3 points] Use a time scale for the x-axis to represent year (recommended function:</li>
</ol>
d3.scaleTime()).&nbsp; It may be necessary to use time parsing / formatting when you load and display the year data. The axis would be overcrowded if you display every year value so set the xaxis ticks to display one tick for every 10 years.

<ol>
<li>[1 point] Set the HTML title tag and display a title for the plot. Set the HTML title tag (i.e., &lt;title&gt;</li>
</ol>
Running Total of TMDb Movies by Year &lt;/title&gt;). Position the title ‚ÄúRunning Total of TMDb Movies by Year‚Äù above the barplot.&nbsp; The title must be a &lt;text&gt; element having the id: ‚Äútitle‚Äù

<ol>
<li>[0.5 points] Add your GT username (usually includes a mix of letters and numbers) to the area beneath the bottom-right of the plot (see example image). The GT username must be a &lt;text&gt; element having the id: ‚Äúcredit‚Äù</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>Gradescope will render your plot using Chrome and present you with a Dropbox link to view the screenshot of your plot with the solution plot in both a side by side and an overlay display.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

The screenshot visual feedback to you for making adjustments and corrections.&nbsp; This is also an excellent way to identify mistakes, <em>e.g.,</em> a blank plot likely indicates a serious error.&nbsp; It is not necessary to exactly duplicate the solution plot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We recommend the following DOM structure and sizing attributes for accurate comparisons:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<strong>Deliverables : Submit the following file to Gradescope: </strong>

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>[1 point] Split the column category_name into multiple columns without removing the original column. For example, a row with ‚ÄúKids/Toys/Dolls &amp; Accessories‚Äù in the category_name column would be split across the newly created columns as ‚ÄúKids‚Äù, ‚ÄúToys‚Äù and ‚ÄúDolls &amp; Accessories‚Äù. Use the existing functionality in OpenRefine that creates multiple columns from an existing column based on a separator (i.e., in this case ‚Äò/‚Äô) and does not remove the original category_name Provide the number of new columns that are created by this operation, excluding the original category_name column.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

Output format and sample values:

ii.columns: 10

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> There are many possible ways to split the data. While we have provided one way to accomplish this in step ii, some methods could create columns that are completely empty. In this dataset, none of the new columns should be completely empty. Therefore, to validate your output, we recommend that you verify that there are no columns that are completely empty, by sorting and checking for null values.

iii. [0.5 points] Select the column name and apply the Text Facet (Facet ‚Üí Text Facet). Cluster by using (Edit Cells ‚Üí Cluster and Edit ‚Ä¶) this opens a window where you can choose different ‚Äúmethods‚Äù and ‚Äúkeying functions‚Äù to use while clustering.

<h1>Q5 [5 points] Introduction to Python Flask</h1>
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> is a lightweight web application framework written in Python that provides you with tools, libraries and technologies to quickly build a web application. It allows you to scale up your application as needed.

&nbsp;

You will modify the given file:

<ul>
<li>wrangling_scripts/wrangling.py</li>
</ul>
<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

<strong>NOTE:</strong> You <strong>must</strong> only use a version of Python ‚â• 3.7.0 and &lt; 3.8 for this question. This question has been developed, tested for these versions. You <strong>must not</strong> use any other versions (e.g., Python 3.8).

&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> You must only use the modules and libraries provided at the top of <strong>wrangling.py</strong> and modules from the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/">Python Standard Library</a> (except Flask). <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> and <a href="https://numpy.org/">Numpy</a> <strong>CANNOT</strong> be used ‚Äî while we understand that they are useful libraries to learn, completing this question is not critically dependent on their functionality. In addition, to enable our TAs to provide better, more consistent support to our students, we have decided to focus on the subset of libraries.

&nbsp;

<strong>Username()</strong>‚Äì Update the username() method inside wrangling.py by including your GTUsername.

&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>Get started by installing Flask on your machine by running pip install Flask (Note that you can optionally create a virtual environment by following the steps <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#virtual-environments">here</a><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/installation/#virtual-environments">.</a> Creating a virtual environment is purely optional and can be skipped.)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>To run the code, you must navigate to the Q5 folder in your terminal/command prompt and execute the following command: python run.py. After running the command go to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:3001/">http://127.0.0.1:3001/</a> on your browser. This will open up index.html showing a table in which the rows returned by data_wrangling() are displayed.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>You must solve the following 2 sub-questions:
<ol>
<li>[2 points] Read the top 100 rows using the data_wrangling() method.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The skeleton code by default reads all the rows from movies.csv. You must add the required code to ensure reading only the <strong>first </strong>100 data rows. The skeleton code already handles reading the table header for you.

&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>[3 points]: Sort the table in <em>descending </em>order of the values i.e., with larger values at the top and smaller values at the bottom of the table in the last (3<sup>rd</sup>) column.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>Deliverables:</strong> <strong>Submit the following file to Gradescope: </strong>

<ul>
<li><strong>wrangling.py </strong>: the completed python file with your changes.</li>
</ul>
